'''
Use PyInstaller to bundle the python code into a standalone executable.

While it is unclear on how to use PyInstaller directly as a python
package, a specifications file can be generated here, and pyinstaller
called as a subprocess to run the compilation, and then the
expected output folders checked for files and manipulated as needed.

Note:
Pyinstaller has two main modes for generated code:

1)  Multiple files in a single folder, with dlls, python bytecode, etc.
    broken out, and the exe acting as a booststrap.
    This creates an ugly folder with a bunch of files lumped in
    with the exe.

2)  Single exe which contains the above files in a packed form, and
    unpacks them to a temp directory when executed, then acting similar
    to (1).
    This is stated as being slower to start, and not cleaning up after
    itself if the program terminates early, which could be bad since
    this customizer is expected to crash when users provide unsupported
    arguments and such (plus it has its own potential bugs to worry
    about).


Option (1) should be a lot safer, and its ugliness has a couple possible
workarounds:

1)  Create a shortcut in a higher level folder which links to the exe,
    so the user can just use the shortcut.
    This is going to be windows-specific, but most or all expected
    users are likely on windows, so this should be okay.
    In testing, this seems to have problems with handling command
    line args properly.

2)  Put misc files into a subfolder, and add that subfolder to the
    system search path using a runtime hook, essentially python code
    that runs at startup before other modules are loaded.
    See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19579979/pyinstaller-changing-dll-and-pyd-output-location
    for an example.
    In practice, any subfolder seems to work without needing the hook,
    though a couple files still need to be kept with the exe to
    the basic bootstrapping.

3)  Make a bat file to launch the app, which can more easily pass
    command line args.



TODO:
Consider bundling with documentation into a zip file automatically,
include all misc files from the source and patches folders.
