'''
Template file for specifying user's transforms.
When X3 Customizer is launched without an input script specified, 
"User_Transforms.py" will be run by default.

Instructions:
1)  Copy or rename this file to "User_Transforms.py".
2)  Edit the 'path_to_x3_folder' argument in Set_Path to point to the
    X3 installation to be modified.
3)  Call any desired transform functions.
    Some select functions are provided as examples, commented out.
    See documentation for a list of all transforms and their arguments.
4)  Run the transforms using Launch_X3_Customizer.bat.
    Note: this will generate a new cat/dat pair in the x3 folder containing
    the edited files, as well as logging some information into the
    addon/x3_customizer_logs folder under the x3 directory.
    The first run will require a restart of X3 to recognize the
    new cat/dat pair.

To remove transforms, either:
a)  Comment out undesired transforms and rerun the input script.
b)  Run Clean_X3_Customizer.bat.
    This will remove the cat/dat pair, requiring a restart of X3.
