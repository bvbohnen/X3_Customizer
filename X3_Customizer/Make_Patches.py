'''
Generate patch files from select modified game files.

Patches allow for distributing edits to some complex (generally compiled)
files in an easier manner, and without having to copy those
code files, plus potentially supporting applying multiple
patches to the same file.

TODO: add a transform file to rebuild the modified source scripts from
 patches, if needed, so that distributions can recreate those modded
 scripts in the patches folder for further editing and regeneration
 of new patches.

Note: currently only supports a single patch per file.
