'''
Generate documentation for the customizer.
This will parse the docstrings at the top of X3_Customizer and
for each transform, and write them to a plain text file.

This can generally be called directly as an entry function.


Quick markdown notes, for the readme which will be dispayed on
github, and the main documentation just because:

 -Newlines don't particularly matter. Can break up lines for a text
 file, and they will get joined back together.

 -This is bad for a list of transforms, since they get lumped together,
 so aim to put markdown characters on them to listify them.

 -Adding asterisks at the start of lines will turn them into a list,
 as long as there is a space between the asterisk and the text.

 -Indentation by 4 spaces or 1 tab creates code blocks; try to avoid 
 this level of indent unless code blocking is intentional.

 -Indentation is built into some docstrings, though the only one that
 should matter for the markdown version is x3_customizer. That one needs
 to be carefully adjusted to avoid 4-space chains, including across
 newlines.

 -Triple -,*,_ will place a horizontal thick line. Can be used between
 sections. Avoid dashes, though, since they make whatever is above them
 into a header, unless that is desired.
